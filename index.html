  <h1>SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
  </div>

  <p>The Solar System[c] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun. The largest objects that orbit the Sun are these eight planets (listed from closest to furthest from the Sun):

    Four terrestrial planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars;
    Two gas giants – Jupiter and Saturn; and
    Two ice giants – Uranus and Neptune.
    All four terrestrial planets belong to the inner Solar System (≤ 1.7 AU) and have a solid surface. Inversely, all four giant planets belong to the outer Solar System (≤ 30.5 AU) and do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass are in Jupiter and Saturn.
    
    Objects that are smaller than the planets are the dwarf planets; there is strong consensus among astronomers that these nine objects meet the criteria:
    
    One asteroid-belt object – Ceres;
    Five Kuiper-belt objects – Pluto, Orcus, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake; and
    Three scattered-disc objects – Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna.
    There are a vast number of smaller objects orbiting the Sun, called small Solar System bodies. This category include asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids and interplanetary dust clouds. Many of these objects are in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter (1.5–4.5 astronomical units, AU), and the Kuiper belt just outside Neptune's orbit (30–50 AU).[d]
    
    The Sun produces a stream of charged particles called the solar wind, creating a bubble-like region known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is a highly variable boundary where the solar wind's pressure is equal to the surrounding interstellar medium. It is theorized that the Oort cloud (from 2,000 to 50,000–200,000 AU) is the source for long-period comets. The end of the Solar System is at the Sun's Hill sphere (50,000–200,000 AU) where surrounding stars have a stronger gravitational influence than the Sun. The closest star to the Solar System is Proxima Centauri (4.25 light years, 270000 AU).
    
    4.6 billion years ago, a giant molecular cloud formed the nascent Solar System. Due to gravitational collapse, the molecular cloud contracted, igniting nuclear fusion in the protostar and forming a protoplanetary disk around it. The protostar then evolves to a G-type main-sequence star – the Sun. The existence of the protoplanetary disk is why massive bodies have orbits that lie near the same plane and rotate in the same direction. The protoplanetary disk is thought to coalesced to form planetesimals, which further interacted to form planets and dwarf planets.
    
    Formation and evolution
    Main article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System
    The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.[e] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.[5] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars.[6]
    
    As the pre-solar nebula[6] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.[5] As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU (30 billion km; 19 billion mi)[5] and a hot, dense protostar at the center.[7][8] The planets formed by accretion from this disc,[9] in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.[</p>
